# About Me
Hello! My name is Cyndi(Yudi) Jia and I'm from Beijing, China. I am a senior student major in _**Interactive Media Arts**_ and minor in _**Sound and Music Computing**_. Having studied IMA for three years, I took a variety of classes including the nature of code, NIME, kinetic interfaces,Video Arts, etc, and I'm fond of creative coding stuff and making installations. I studied away in Abu Dhabi during Fall 2018 semester, where I took many music classes and decided to minor in Sound and Music Computing, and spent my Spring 2019 semester in New York taking ITP classes.

Application Lab is a new field for me to explore, and one of my potential direction for my career path, as I am thinking about applying for graduate programs related to Human Computer Interaction. Throughout my past three years of studying IMA, I've been making art projects that people may or may not understand. But I'm always thinking about one question: _**Where can my projects be used for? How can I make the stuff I designed to serve people and make our lives more efficient?**_ And that's a big part of the reason of me taking this class, because I really want to learn something related to human-centered design, to truly research and understand what people really need in modern lives.

As for programming skills, I've learned Arduino, Processing, P5.js, Python, HTML,CSS and JavaScirpt in the past. React.js is totally new to me and I'm very happy to learn about it.
